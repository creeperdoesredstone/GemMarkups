# GUI Languages Documentation

These languages are designed for EmeraldOS's graphics engine.

## GemXML `(.xml)`

GemXML is an XML-based language designed for general-purpose graphics for EmeraldOS.

### Structure of a tag
```xml
<tag attribute="value">content</tag>
```

### Basic GemXML tags

- To make a window in GemXML, use the `<window>` tag as follows:
```xml
<window width="width" height="height" title="title">
	...
</window>
```
> üìù **Note:** The `<window>` tag is required in GemXML files.<br>
> Only one window can be in a GemXML file at a time.

- The `<text>` tag can be used to specify a text element:
```xml
<text>Hello, world!</text>
```

### A Basic GemXML Window
```xml
<window width="28" height="13" title="HI">
	<text>Hello,</text>
	<text>world</text>
</window>
```
The window should, *in theory*, look something like this:
> ![A window displaying 'Hello, world'](helloworld.png)

### Containers

A `<div>` acts as a container of elements.
```xml
<div>
	...
</div>
```

### Classes and IDs

Classes and IDS can be entered as attributes:
```xml
<tag class="className" id="idName"></tag>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Like HTML, classes can be used by multiple objects, while IDs are unique and can only be used by one object.

Unlike HTML, the GemXML compiler will crash out if you try to use an ID for 2 or more objects.

### Shapes

GemXML supports the following shapes:
- Lines (using the `<line>` tag):
```xml
<line
	startx="x" starty="y" endx="x" endy="y"
></line>
```
- Rectangles (using the `<rect>` tag):
```xml
<rect
	x="x" y="y" width="width" height="height"
></rect>
```
- Circles (using the `<circle>` tag):
```xml
<circle
	x="x" y="y" radius="radius"
></circle>
```

### Including external files
To include an external file, you can use the `<include>` tag as follows:
```xml
<include as="style">style.gms</include>
```
Currently, the only types supported are listed here:
| Include as | File format | Purpose       |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `style`    | `.gms`      | Styling       |
| `md`       | `.gmd`      | Markdown Text |

### Default attributes

GemXML provides default values for attributes of the tags listed below.

> üìù **Note:** Despite this, you should *always* specify an object's attributes. Otherwise, this could lead to unintended behavior.

<details>
<summary><code>&lt;window&gt;</code></summary>

- `x = 45`
- `y = 35`
- `width = 30`
- `height = 20`
</details>

<details>
<summary><code>&lt;rect&gt;</code></summary>

- `x = window.width/2 - 5`
- `y = window.height/2 - 3`
- `width = 10`
- `height = 6`
</details>

<details>
<summary><code>&lt;circle&gt;</code></summary>

- `x = window.width / 2`
- `y = window.height / 2`
- `radius = 4`
</details>

## GemSheet `(.gms)`

GemSheet is a CSS-based language.<br>
Contents of a GemSheet file can be included in a GemXML file using the `<include>` tag.

### Basic syntax

A GemSheet file contains one or more blocks. <br>
Each block follows the following structure:

```
<selectors> {
	<property>: <values>;
}
```

### Selectors

#### Element selector

Selects elements based on the element name (`text`, `div`, ...)

#### ID Selector

Selects a specific element based on its ID. <br>
To select an element based on a unique ID, write a hash character (`#`) followed by the ID name.

#### Class Selector

Selects elements with a specific class. <br>
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (`.`) followed by the class name.

### Shades

GemSheet supports only 4 shades:
- `0: #31f582`
- `1: #40bfae`
- `2: #4d4d7f`
- `3: #38154f`

## GemMD `(.md)`

GemMD is a Markdown-based language designed to style text.<br>
Contents of a Markdown file can be included in a GemXML file using the `<include>` tag.
